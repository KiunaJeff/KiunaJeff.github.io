## Introduction
In this lab, I examined how misconfigured or open SMB (Server Message Block) shares can be exploited by attackers to access sensitive information and gain unauthorized access to a system.

---

## Enumeration
Using `nmap`, I scanned the target and identified that ports **139** and **445** were open, confirming that SMB was running.  

Example command:
```bash
nmap -p 139,445 --script=smb-enum-shares,smb-enum-users <target-ip>
```

The scan revealed that the `public` share was accessible without authentication.

---

## Exploitation
I connected to the share using:
```bash
smbclient \\\\<target-ip>\\public
```

Once inside, I was able to list files and download sensitive documents, such as configuration files and user credentials.  
These could then be leveraged for further lateral movement or privilege escalation.

## Mitigation
To secure SMB shares:
- Disable SMBv1 and enforce modern secure versions (SMBv2/3).
- Require authentication for all shares (no anonymous access).
- Restrict access using least privilege principles.
- Monitor SMB traffic for suspicious activity.

## Conclusion
This lab demonstrated how attackers can exploit misconfigured SMB shares to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files.  
It highlighted the importance of securing network services and monitoring file-sharing activity.
